<h1> ENCRYPTOR </h1>

<h5>Encode a passphrase that will return a URL, from which anyone can visit.  Upon arrival of page, conspirators are asked for the password.  Attempts and incorrect passwords prompt for the correct password.  Once the password is entered, the passphase is recorded in a alert box as well as posting to the page.

I liked working with the JS objects.  Learned about singletons and their application.</h5>
